nos2014assignment
=================

For this assignment you will be applying both network and operating systems programming
techniques.

Your overall task is to implement a very simplified multi-threaded Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.

I have provided you with a test program that you will use to track your progress and
guide your work.  I will use the same test program to assess your submissions, so you
can have good confidence prior to final submission as to the range in which your
assessment will be graded. 

I say range, because the technical component of this
assignment is worth 84%, with the remaining 16% being for style and readability of your
program. This will cover aspects such as a comprehendable architecture (which will of
course help you as you write it anyway), appropriate comments, clarity, brevity, and
use of efficient and appropriate algorithms and techniques.

Comments should address
why the code it documents is necessary, i.e., what would go wrong if it wasn't there,
rather than what the code does -- after all, anyone can read the code to see what it
does, but understanding WHY it is there is not so trivial.
  
In other words, to get an
HD your program must be both machine and human readable.

Useful resources for the operating systems programming aspects
--------------------------------------------------------------

pthreads functions:

You will need pthread_create(), pthread_exit() and the pthread_rwlock functions.
